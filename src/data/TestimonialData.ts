Here i am now, proudly a product of the Motive Africa Visual Academy. I will always be forever grateful, because i am proud of what i have become and what i will become, all because of MAVA Thank you Precious Orji (the Motive himself); as you have  helped people like me, God will help you! Thank you MAVA as a whole",

Though, i have it in mind to learn photography but photography is quite expensive and my parents could not afford it cause there are so many responsibilities. But, glory to God, MAVA gave me a focus, a future and an opportunity to achieve something in life. I'm forever grateful to MAVA, i didn't just learn photography, i also learnt branding, networking, businessnof photography, portfolio formation and internship opportunities. God bless MAVA.",

Two months of intensive teaching & practicals and also learning the basics  of Photography. We've had experienced photographers coming over to teach us for free! I am honestly forever grateful to MAVA for finding me worthy of this opportunity, Thank you so much MAVA!",
