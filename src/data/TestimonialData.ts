I will always be forever grateful, because i am proud of what i have become and what i will become, all because of MAVA Thank you Precious Orji (the Motive himself); as you have  helped people like me, God will help you! Thank you MAVA as a whole",

Though, i have it in mind to learn photography but photography is quite expensive and my parents could not afford it cause there are so many responsibilities. But, glory to God, MAVA gave me a focus, a future and an opportunity to achieve something in life. I'm forever grateful to MAVA, i didn't just learn photography, i also learnt branding, networking, businessnof photography, portfolio formation and internship opportunities. God bless MAVA.",

Learning Photography has been a smooth ride with MAVA, I've been able to learn so many things about photography and outside photography. I met so many people with different ideas, i connected with different people. Some of the people we look up to on social media, MAVA brought them to us in person and it was amazing. One of the things i learnt in MAVA was not to box yourself into a position. we're to spread our wings and fly.",
